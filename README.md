# Grocery-List-CRUD-app-with-MVVM

Basic Android CRUD app with MVVM architecture. 
This is my first time using MVVM, and was used as a practice run to understand the concepts
I also practiced using manual dependency injection to understand what Dagger/Hilt does under the hood

App utilizes:
- Room database
- Manual dependency injection
- MVVM architecture
- Jetpack Navigation component, with simple app bar
- Safeargs
- Kotlin coroutines, flow, channel, and LiveData
- RecyclerView -> ListView
